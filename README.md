Basically, one day I was too lazy to open Google Drive > folder > folder > text document

Because it was always tedious to go through all that just to access a text editor, I needed something basic. So I thought, 'Why not create one myself?'

And that's basically it. You can input text, edit, save, and load. It has autosave, font size adjustment, and a little mascot in the corner so I don't feel lonely. Just the 'NECESSARY' essentials, as God intended and designed it, simple, lightweight, useful.
